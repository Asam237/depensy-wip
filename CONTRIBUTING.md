## Making changes to the code

### Preparing your development environment
To learn how to build and run the code, follow the instructions in the [README](README.md).

### Style guidelines
The code in this project uses official [Kotlin coventions](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coding-conventions.html).

### Workflow
This project uses the [GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) where most
development happens directly on the `master` branch. The `master` branch should always be in a
healthy state which is ready for release.

## Submitting a pull request and participating in code review
Writing a good description for your pull request is crucial to help reviewer and future
maintainers understand your change. More detail is better.
- [Link the issue you're addressing in the pull request](https://github.com/blog/957-introducing-issue-mentions).
- Describe *why* the change is being made and *why* you've chosen a particular solution.

Please submit one pull request per issue. Large pull requests which have unrelated changes can be
difficult to review.

After submitting a pull request, members of the project will review your code and approve
the request if ok.
